## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to clone this repository and install the required dependencies. Follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: You need Node.js installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: npm comes with Node.js. If you don't have npm installed, you can get it from the Node.js installer.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-smartwrite-plugin.git

## Building for Production

To generate the production-ready version of the app, run the following command:
